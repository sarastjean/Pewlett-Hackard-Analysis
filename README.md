# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Purpose and Reason

For Pewlett-Hackard, there will be 72,458 employees expected to retire in the next few years which is being referred to as the “Silver Tsunami” within the company. If management does not address this issue now and prepare, the company will eventually be impacted when top talent, like Senior Engineers and Senior Staff all start leaving around the same time. The issue is that it is mainly “Senior Level” employees that are retiring which leaves newer employees to be put in decision making roles. Without guidance and mentorship, this could potentially harm the company. They knew there was going to be an issue but the data analysis gave exact reality and the scope of the problem so the company can get ahead of the outcome.

### Problem-Solving Steps and Challenges

To solve the problem, I joined several various data sources to get a cohesive list of all employees born between 1952-1955 and who currently work at the company. I also did an analysis of the different titles and how many employees will retire with what title. There was a second table created to identify employees who could be mentored by the upcoming retirees. I did not face any challenges in putting this analysis together. It was helpful the challenge instructions included how to remove duplicates or that would have been difficult without any assistance. I included the SELECT COUNT for my tables to get an idea or how my different codes affected the totals.

### Recommendations and Further Investigation

There are 72,458 employees set to retire, 70% of which hold the titles of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. Looking at the Mentorship Eligibility list, there are only 1,549 employees for this potential program and in addition to that, most already hold Senior Level titles. My recommendation would be to go younger for the program. Born in 1965 put someone at 55 years old. If you want to create change and advance your company, look at the younger employees who will be around for a bit longer because PH will just have this issue again in the next few years. Also, the salaries do not seem accurate either. A Senior Engineer making $50k at age 60 is a little low. To replace almost 73,000 employees, I would recommend training and gathering applicants for the empty roles quickly.
